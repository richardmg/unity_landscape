- Environment will consist of objects that are flat, but that can have several layers
    E.g a cow would have body, legs, perhaps eyes / ears as separate layers
- Each layer should ideally have a uniform thickness (like a card board)
- Objects are inclined to face the camera sideways / billboarded at a distance.
    - Static objects like trees will do this in the shader, and when billboarded, consist
        of one layer.
    - Dynamic objects should perhaps billboard from script, perhaps by walking in a 
        "natural" way so they end up posing so.
