1.
- Environment will consist of objects that are flat, but that can have several layers
    E.g a cow would have body, legs, perhaps eyes / ears as separate layers
- Each layer should ideally have a uniform thickness (like a card board)
- Objects are inclined to face the camera sideways / billboarded at a distance.
    - Static objects like trees will do this in the shader, and when billboarded, consist
        of one layer.
    - Dynamic objects should perhaps billboard from script, perhaps by walking in a 
        "natural" way so they end up posing so.

2.
- Still flat objects, but buildt up with cubes to give some depth.
    The player can draw new limbs and pieces in a pixel editor
    Or perhaps you cannot draw limbs yourself, but need to harwest
    species / plants from the world, and combine / mate them.
    The world must then consist of a rich fauna of material.

- You somehow need to catch
    a species before you can "mate" with it. And perhaps that you then can
    choose how the new children should evolve.
- Crippled versions of the species you
    have added to world will come and haunt at night.

3.
- Pearly
- There is no game, only about creating a fantasy world
- The user is creating everything with pearls 2D.
- This way, the card boards get natural depth. All pearls are billboarded.
- The pearl "D editor, you choose what kind of piece you will create (head
  eye, leg, arm, tree, wall, flower, wing).
- The piece 3D editor lets you assemple all pieces freely into a creature or building
  - the species and constructions will then be added in a shared world
  on the net for everyone to explore. Perhaps the whole land you created
  can be instered somehow.

4. Flat objects with some depth (plates)
    - You are in a clearing in a forest.
    - you can take down a tree to get plates (e.g 2 per tree)
    - a tree will only contain static plates, so you can only build static constructions with them
        but freely draw / change the default plate drawing.
    - animals living in the forest can also be captures, and will give more advanced plates to
        build with (head, legs, torso, eyes etc). The further in to the forest you go, the bigger
        or more interresting animals / plants you will find.
    - beasts also live in the forest, but never comes out in the clearing (which grows bigger as
        the user harwest trees). Or, they only comes out some meters out of the clearing.
    - Make the daylight darker when entering the forrest. Creatures will have shining eyes.
    - The more trees around the user, the darker the light. The user can create new clearings in
        the forrest.
    - the beasts will try to catch your species and mutate with them into ugly twisted versions.
    - an important point will be why the user should be tempted to go out into the forrest, and
        why he would need to create species etc.
